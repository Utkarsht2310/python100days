#Generators in Python are special type of functions that allow you to create an iterable sequence of values. A generator function returns a generator object, which can be used to generate the values one-by-one as you iterate over it. Generators are a powerful tool for working with large or complex data sets, as they allow you to generate the values on-the-fly, rather than having to create and store the entire sequence in memory.

def my_generator():
    for i in range(50000000):
      # Complex computations
      yield i

gen = my_generator()
# print(next(gen))
# print(next(gen))
# print(next(gen))

for j in  gen:
  print(j)
